# Homebrew cask template for EQ Ape, for a PERSONAL TAP (not homebrew/homebrew-cask).
#
# Tap repository: github.com/Mukimies/homebrew-tap   (the repo MUST be named homebrew-<something>;
#   "homebrew-tap" gives the short tap name Mukimies/tap)
# Location in the tap: Casks/eq-ape.rb
# Install:  brew tap Mukimies/tap && brew trust Mukimies/tap && brew install --cask eq-ape
#   (Homebrew 7 refuses casks from a tap that was not tapped and trusted explicitly)
#
# Per release: `dist/update-cask.sh <version> dist/out/EQ-Ape-<version>.dmg.sha256 > Casks/eq-ape.rb`
# prints this file with `version` and `sha256` replaced (the release workflow also prints it in the job
# summary). Never edit a published release's DMG; a new build is a new version.
#
# The first release (0.1.0-beta.1) is ad-hoc signed and NOT notarized. The official homebrew-cask repository
# does not accept such apps (see docs/DISTRIBUTION.md section 8), so this cask is for the personal tap only.
# `brew fetch --cask` (download + checksum) and `brew audit --cask` passed for 0.1.0-beta.2 on Homebrew 7.0.13;
# `brew install` has never been run against this file.

  caveats <<~EOS
    EQ Ape is a pre-release and is not notarized by Apple. macOS will refuse to open it at first:
    double-click it, close the alert, then open System Settings > Privacy & Security and click
    "Open Anyway" next to the EQ Ape message. The audio-capture permission will probably have to be
    granted again after each update. Answer the permission prompt promptly: an unanswered prompt can
    stall new audio for every app until it is answered.
